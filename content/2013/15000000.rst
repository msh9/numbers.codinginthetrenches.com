Speaking of things that require college degrees (see yesterday's post): The Linux kernel
as of 2011 had `15+ million lines of code spread across 37000 files`_. I've worked on
a few relatively complex applications recently, but they have all been measured in multiples
of 10000 lines. Anything measured in millions of lines of code really does take a community
effort to maintain.
