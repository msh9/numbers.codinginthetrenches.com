At least 23000_ individuals lost their lives due to antibiotic resistant infections last year.

The CDC_ recently released a report on the antibiotic resistant pathogens. It's frightening,
almost as frightening as a Department of Defence Concept Plan to `handle a Influenza pandemic`_
that *starts out* with an assumption that 2,000,000+ citizens will die.

As frightening as the CDC report is, however it's worth a read. The report is well written and
contains a lot of useful information about the origin of drug resistant bacteria and fungus,
how we are currently making the problem, what to do about it, and some of the greatest current
threats.

Finally, to bang on a drum that I've hit before: Number of deaths of private US citizens due
to terrorism in 2012? According to the Department of State there were 10_ such deaths.
