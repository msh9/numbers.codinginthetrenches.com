4.22 is roughly the number `of light years`_ from Earth to the closest star in the
Alpha Centauri system, Proxima Centauri. Just to be clear 4.22 light years works
out to roughly 39,900,000,000,000 km, this is a really big number. 

Recalling an
earlier post, approximately `262.1 billion`_ vehicle miles were estimated to have
occurred in US for May 2013. If we extrapolate the May travel figure out over
12 months then it would take **~7.9 years** at 262.1 billion miles per month to 
travel the distance between Earth and Proxima Centauri. 

It's hard to describe
and comprehend the distances involved when it comes to travel off our planet.
