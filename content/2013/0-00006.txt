~0.00006% is the `rate of occurence`_ of the phrase 'once upon a time' in Google books `Ngram Viewer`_ when
it peaked around 1922. The link also includes the phrase 'dark and stormy night' in reference to the much
joked about opener 'It was a dark and stormy night..'. Interestingly the maligned dark and stormy opener
has never occurred as often as the apparantly much more common phrase 'once upon a time.'
