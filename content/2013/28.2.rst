`According the US Census quick facts page`_ the percentage of persons age 25+
holding a bachelor's degree or higher is 28.2%. In the same age group the
percentage of people with a GED or better is 85.4%.

*Great*, so as a country we're mostly literate in **basic** high school reading,
writing, mathematics, and science. This could be considered a good thing
since we're in much better shape than 100 years ago. On the other hand it
means that there are a number of positions in economy which require 4 years
degrees at a minimum that are out of reach to many.
