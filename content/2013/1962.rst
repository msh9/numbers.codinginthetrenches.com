`1962 was the year`_ a coal mine started in Centralia, PA that could
potentially burn for some time yet to come. The fire caused most people
in the town to evacuate by the mid-1990s leaving a few who decided to
stay. It is literally a slow, smoldering, underground hazard. According 
to the linked article there are a number of ongoing underground and surface coal
fires in the US.

Marshmallows anyone?
