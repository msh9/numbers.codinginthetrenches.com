`262.1 **billion**`_ vehicle miles was the U.S. Department of Transportation's
estimated travel figure for the month of May in 2013, in units used by the rest
of the world that yields roughly 422 billion kilometers traveled.

It's really astonishing to me that the distance traveled by vehicles in 
1 month just in the US is measured in hundreds of billions of miles. When 
considering this figure it's worth keeping in mind that the maximum distance
from Earth to Mars is `~401 **million** kilometers`_ or about 1000 times *less*
than the vehicle miles for the month of may.
